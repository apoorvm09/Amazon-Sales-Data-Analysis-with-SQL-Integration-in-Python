# Amazon_Sales_Data_Analysis

The data has been extracted online using API. The data has seperate recods of Amazon sales (2019) month-wise. 

The data was first stored in My SQL Workbench and then it was connected to python by creating a pipeline between SQL and Python for EDA.

The data was then processed and cleaned by performing EDA, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection and Data Visualization, with the main aim to get useful insights from the data in hand.

A lot of new features were added and created, out of which a lot of analysis has been done. 

All the Graphical Visualisations have been shared, along with the excel file (AMAZON_PROJECT_OUTPUT) with some useful insights that were gathered from the dataset. 


Data- Only the sales data of January month is added (Sales_January_2019). 

Code File- Private
