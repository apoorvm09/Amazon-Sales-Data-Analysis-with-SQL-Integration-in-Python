# Amazon_Sales_Data

The data has been extracted online using API. The data has seperate recods of Amazon sales (2019) monthly. 

The data was first stored in My SQL Workbench and then it was connected to python by creating a pipeline between SQL and Python.

Then the data was processed and cleaned using EDA, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection and Data Visualization, with the main aim to get useful insights from the data in hand.

A lot of new features were added and created, out of which a lot of analysis has been done. 

All the Visualisations have been shared, along with the excel file (AMAZON_PROJECT_OUTPUT) of some useful insights gathered from the data. 


Data- Only the sales data of January month is added (Sales_January_2019).
